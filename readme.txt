= Do you have additional hooks and filters that developers can make use of? =

Indeed we do. From the inception of this plugin we wanted to make things extensible for those times you need to make something special happen. Take a look at our <a href="http://captpro.evan-herman.com/documentation/?utm_source=plugin-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme">documentation</a> for a full list of hooks and filters and how to use them.

= Do you integrate with any other plugins? Can I create tesetimonials for WooCommerce/Easy Digital Download products? =

Yes! We've included the ability to import existing WooCommerce or Easy Digital Download products directly into Client and Product Testimonials. Once you import the products from the chosen plugin, you can begin assigning your testimonials to the respective product.

On top of that, if you use any of the included shortcodes or widgets on the single_product template (for either plugin) - the testimonials will be filtered to only return testimonials assigned to that given product. This allows you to quickly and easily display testimonials assigned to a product.

With the pro version you can add our frontend submission form to start accepting testimonials from your customers, for each of your products.
